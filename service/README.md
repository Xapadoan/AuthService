# AuthService - Service

**NOTE**: I made this service out of curiosity. It is not meant for real world use.

This service is meant to enforce passwordless login using a picture of a user's identity card as credentials instead. It's meant to be a safe way of login (in the future).
Your final user will just have to enter an email and take a picture of its ID card and that's it.
